# Install Payload for Persistence
Persistence simply means payload will run again either upon startup/reboot or certain trigger, so as to re-establish C2 (Command & Control) session with the remote/external C2 server. 

The samples are further divided beyond payload types into userland or elevated. The former means running as standard user, the latter means running as admin or SYSTEM rights.
