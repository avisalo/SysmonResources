# Install Payload for Persistence
Persistence simply means payload will runs again either upon startup/reboot or certain trigger so as to re-establish C2 session with the remote/external C2 server. 

The samples are further divided beyond payload types into userland or elevated. The former means running as standard user, the latter means running as admin or SYSTEM rights.
