# Equation Editor Exploit (CVE-2017-11882)
## Background
Equation Editor is a tool in MS-Office suite to create embedded equations. [https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Equation-Editor-6eac7d71-3c74-437b-80d3-c7dea24fdf3f](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Equation-Editor-6eac7d71-3c74-437b-80d3-c7dea24fdf3f) It will be removed from all versions that have installed the January 2018 Public Update.

It contains a stack buffer overflow vulnerability that allows remote code execution on a vulnerable system: [https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/12/unit42-analysis-of-cve-2017-11882-exploit-in-the-wild/](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/12/unit42-analysis-of-cve-2017-11882-exploit-in-the-wild/)

So what's the big deal? We have macros, DDE & what not. Well, some of the legit mechanisms can be disabled, or it may prompt warning thus require more social engineering (deception) & user intervention (eg. click yes, go, ok). 

Bug exploitation on the other hand, will run automatically & silently... but some exploits may lead to crashes & system instability (eg. blue-screen).

## Payload
One can either generate a payload from [metasploit module](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/windows/fileformat/office_ms17_11882) or with the python generator attached here. This exploit is rather stable & reliable.

Why choose this payload from so many...?
