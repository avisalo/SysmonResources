# Equation Editor Exploit (CVE-2017-11882)
## Background
Equation Editor is a tool in MS-Office suite to create embedded equations. [https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Equation-Editor-6eac7d71-3c74-437b-80d3-c7dea24fdf3f](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Equation-Editor-6eac7d71-3c74-437b-80d3-c7dea24fdf3f) It will be removed from all versions that have installed the January 2018 Public Update.

It contains a stack buffer overflow vulnerability that allows remote code execution on a vulnerable system: [https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/12/unit42-analysis-of-cve-2017-11882-exploit-in-the-wild/](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/12/unit42-analysis-of-cve-2017-11882-exploit-in-the-wild/)

So what's the big deal? We have macros, DDE & what not. Well, some of the legit mechanisms can be disabled, or it may prompt warning thus require more social engineering (deception) & user intervention (eg. click yes, go, ok). 

Bug exploitation on the other hand, will run automatically & silently... but some exploits may lead to crashes & system instability (eg. blue-screen).

## Payload
One can either generate a payload with [metasploit module](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/windows/fileformat/office_ms17_11882) or [python generator script](https://github.com/jymcheong/SysmonResources/blob/master/6.%20Sample%20Data/stage%202%20(Get%20In)/2.%20run%20payloads/(Type%203)%20Winword%20RTF%20EqnEditor%20Exploit/cve2017-11882.py). This exploit is rather stable & reliable.

Why choose this payload from so many other exploits? We have seen a sample that [exploits the browser](https://github.com/jymcheong/SysmonResources/tree/master/6.%20Sample%20Data/stage%202%20(Get%20In)/2.%20run%20payloads/(Type%203)%20IE%20Browser%20Exploit) without a file interaction & it performs a [Meterpreter Process Migration](https://github.com/jymcheong/SysmonResources/tree/master/6.%20Sample%20Data/stage%202%20(Get%20In)/2.%20run%20payloads/(Type%203)%20Meterpreter%20Process%20Migration). 

We have also observed from Type 2 samples, questionable code-execution that has a direct Parent -> Child process relationships. 

*So I thought it would be apt to use a sample that is delivered via a weaponised content, but does not cause a direct Parent (word) -> Child (calc.exe) execution.*
