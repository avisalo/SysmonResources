## Payload
I will also use this sample to illustrate the idea of attack-chaining by linking it to [another sample which is Type 1 - Rundll32 Allthethings.dll](https://github.com/jymcheong/SysmonResources/tree/master/6.%20Sample%20Data/stage%202%20(Get%20In)/2.%20run%20payloads/(Type%201)%20Allthethings.dll%20with%20rundll32)
