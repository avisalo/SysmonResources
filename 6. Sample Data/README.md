# Sample Data Sets

Will be uploading sample sample Sysmon logs related to various aspects of an **A**ttack **L**ife **C**ycle. MITRE has a set of data from a [BRAWL Automated Adversary Emulation Exercise](https://github.com/mitre/brawl-public-game-001/tree/master/data).

MITRE's ATT&CK is a comprehensive enumeration of techniques associated to tactical groups, but we wanted a model that was more easy to grasp in terms of wording & also to distinct between external & inside (stage 3 & 4) threats, & beyond breach of confidentiality:

When working with users who are more technical & want to stick to frameworks from more "branded" organisations (eg. MITRE, big-four consulting & the likes), so we tend to use MITRE ATT&CK in our dialogue/engagements. But for all intent & purposes, the ALC is easier for communicating with non-technical stake-holders & is almost equivalent.
