# Run payload (Execution)
This sub-folder holds sample log data from code execution that can be observed with Sysmon. 

**I am NOT trying to capture logs from all possible types of payloads** but rather some representative to help those who are new to Sysmon to better understand the significance of fields within various Sysmon Event types. 

Most of the offensive code execution will be based on Metasploit & Empire frameworks. I will also include logs from normal application execution so as to help contrast the differences/deltas that we can observe from Sysmon Events.
